            <div class="bio">In today’s hyper-connected world, customers hold an immense amount of power. They can use social media, online reviews, and other channels to share their experiences and opinions about businesses.
                As a result, companies are increasingly recognising the importance of gathering and leveraging customer opinions.

            <div class="bio2">In addition, this can help attract new customers and retain existing ones, as customers are more likely to do business with a company that values their opinions and takes steps to address their concerns.</div>

            <div class="bio2">Customer opinion can also help businesses improve customer satisfaction. Thus, by listening to customer feedback, businesses can identify areas where they are falling short and take steps to address these issues.
                For example, if customers consistently complain about long wait times on the phone, a business can invest in additional customer service representatives to reduce wait times. Therefore, by improving customer satisfaction, businesses can increase customer retention and referrals, leading to long-term growth.</div>

            <div class="bio4">One of the most significant advantages of customer opinion is that it can help businesses gain a better understanding of their customers’ needs. Thus, by gathering feedback through surveys, focus groups, or online reviews, businesses can learn about their customers’ pain points, preferences, and expectations. </div>
